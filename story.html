            <div class="row mt-5 mb-5 card">
                            <h5 class="card-header"><span class="bold">Past</span></h5>
                            <div class="card-body p-2">
                                <p>Malcolm took his first computer science class at John Jay Science and Engineering Academy High School where he learned the fundamentals of the field and practiced coding in C++. After graduating high school, he attended The University of Texas at Austin to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Part of the degree curriculum included Programming and Computational Methods course where he learned more about using C++.</p>
                                
                                <p>While he enjoyed programming in both of the classes mentioned, Malcolm continued with his studies to earn a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and became an Engineer-in-Training. He began his professional career as a Dam Safety Engineering Specialist for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The position allowed him to travel across the state of Texas and inspect various dams and perform engineering analyses. This marked a departure from his Mechanical Engineering background. Through this educational and career change, Malcolm gained experience in the field of Hydraulics & Hydrology and Civil Engineering.</p>
                                
                                <p> After a few years at TCEQ, he moved to Spokane, Washington to pursue a new opportunity. He became an engineer for the Spokane County Public Works Department in their Environmental Programs Section. There he began his current journey into the world of floodplain management. One of his primary duties outside of performing floodplain management for Spokane County was overseeing mechanical equipment and field operations as an engineer for the Newman Lake Flood Control Zone District.</p>
                                
                                <p>Through the work performed at those two jobs, Malcolm had earned enough experience to qualify to take the Professional Engineering (P.E.) exam. The exam he planned to take was the Civil Engineering: Water Resources exam which consisted of a breadth portion and a depth portion. Because the breadth section contained questions about general Civil Engineering concepts and the depth portion had questions related to Water Resources topics Malcolm had not been exposed to yet, he needed additional learning.</p>

                                <p>For 9 months leading up to the October 2020 exam, Malcolm spent many hours independently learning Civil Engineering and taking an exam-prep course in the evenings and weekends to prepare. Those efforts paid off as he passed the exam and earned his P.E. license. While the Pacific Northwest will always be a fond location for Malcolm, he made the personal decision to return home to Texas a few months after obtaining his P.E. license.</p>

                                <p>In September 2022, Malcolm enrolled in a Software Developer Bootcamp through the Austin Community College (ACC) to relearn and expand on the programming skills he had from the past. Through the experience, he was reminded of the technical challenge and excitement that coding gives him. This sparked the current journey that he is on to improve upon his skill set and become a software engineer.</p>

                                <p>Malcolm now works for the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) as a senior-level Engineer Project Manager for the Flood Infrastructure Fund (FIF) Program. He directly manages 15 FIF Category 1 grant projects and provides assistance on 31 additional projects. The Category 1 projects provide approximately $72.5 million in flood study-related funding throughout the state.</p>
                                
                                <p>Since completing the ACC Software Bootcamp, Malcolm is currently seeking a career change into the tech industry. He is interested in directly working in software development, but is also open to a technical project manager role supporting software development. His current career goals include learning Java, C++, and Python to expand his knowledge of programming languages. He is also practicing React through tutorial projects to improve his skills.</p>
